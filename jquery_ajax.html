    There are two types of Page Fragments: Sections and Components. A Section defines columns, padding, and spacing on the page. A Component contains content that is added to a Section.

Fragments are created inside of Collections. Collections provide an easy way to manage and share groups of related Fragments. Users navigate Collections when selecting Fragments to add to a page. To see examples, the admin page shows all the out-of-the-box Fragments (and their code).

You can create and manage Fragments and Collections without using any external tools, but you can also use your preferred web development tools. For an explanation of Fragment creation using Liferay’s built in tools, see Creating a Fragment.
